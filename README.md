# GoogleIcons
this is an attempt to somehow maintain the original GoogleIcons adaptive icon pack by [amirzaidi](https://github.com/amirzaidi/); original icon pack hasn't been updated in 2+ years

Icon pack works on most popular launchers (Nova, Lawnchair, hyperion, LineageOS' Trebuchet etc.) running on Android 8+; can't guarantee it'll work on OEM launchers that allows third-party icon packs

## Contributing
by all means if you have issues and/or improvements to the pack please do a PR

## Download
For now, it's only available on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/diyachan/GoogleIcons/releases/). Enable allow apps from unknown sources before sideloading
